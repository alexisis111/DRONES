# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a complete, responsive website for "ООО «ЛЕГИОН»" - a company providing complex engineering protection systems against drones for industrial facilities, with light/dark theme support, mobile responsiveness, and properly separated components.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4
- **Project Structure**: Located at D:\DRONES with standard Vite setup and components directory
- **Theme System**: Uses CSS variables and Tailwind's dark mode with 'class' strategy, with oklch(20.8% 0.042 265.755) for dark mode background
- **State Management**: React hooks for theme persistence in localStorage
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints for all screen sizes
- **Component Architecture**: Split into separate components (Header, Hero, Services, ProtectionFeatures, HowWeWork, Contact, Footer)
- **Build Commands**: `npm run build` and `npm run dev`
